# Intelligent Chatbot System

This is an intelligent chatbot system built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including NLTK, TF-IDF, and cosine similarity.

## Installation

To install this chatbot system, you will need to follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/hrsh22/Intelligent-Chatbot-System.git
```
2. Locate the Notebook.
3. Run the Notebook by clicking the "Run" button.


## Usage

The chatbot is designed to answer questions based on a predefined dataset. To use the chatbot, simply type in your question and press enter. The chatbot will analyze your question using NLP techniques and return the most relevant answer.

## NLP Techniques Used

The following NLP techniques are used in this chatbot system:

### NLTK

[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) is a popular Python library for NLP. In this chatbot system, NLTK is used to tokenize the user's question and the FAQs, as well as to remove stop words.

### TF-IDF

[TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is a statistical measure that evaluates the relevance of a term in a document. In this chatbot system, TF-IDF is used to calculate the relevance of each FAQ to the user's question.

### Cosine Similarity

[Cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space. In this chatbot system, cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between the user's question and each of the FAQs.

## Future Improvements

The chatbot system can be improved in several ways, including:

- Adding more FAQs to improve the accuracy of the system
- Using more advanced NLP techniques to improve the accuracy of the system
- Implementing a learning mechanism to allow the chatbot to learn from user interactions and improve over time
